# vsinder-obfuscated-c
A C program which outputs "Hello, vsinder!".

Created because of this meme https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfd8RyAJh6c

Also because I've always wanted to try c obfuscation.

Currently it is too obfuscated at 689 characters while the vsinder addon only takes 600 characters :(

# Compatibility
Requires at least C99 due to the compound literal operator.
